# nba-higher-lower

This project was created using Python. 
This is a different version of the classic Higher or Lower Game using NBA stats.
I sourced my data from Basketball Reference and the data is up-to-date as of March 8th, 2025

Currently, this game only compares NBA player total points stats for the 2024-2025 Regular Season.

With that being said, enjoy the game!
